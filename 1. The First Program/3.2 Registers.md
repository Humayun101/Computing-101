CPU need rapid access to data they are working on, this is done via register file

register lives in your CPU and they are of the same size as the word width of the architecture. 
On a 64-bit architecture, register will hold 64 bits (8 bytes)

Registers can be accessed partially
rax=64 bit (whole)
eax= 32 bit (half)
ax= 16 bit
ah/al=8 bit

 All partial accesses on AMD64

Assembly Instruction mov is used to load data into registers
mov rax, 0x539
mov rbx, 1337
data specified directly in instruction like this is called Immediate value
u can also load into partial register as in above picture 
mov ah, 0x5
mov al, 0x39

You can also mov data between registers 
mov rax, 0x539
mov rbx, rax
