Recall that registers in x86_64 are 64 bits wide, meaning they can store 64 bits. Similarly, each memory location can be treated as a 64-bit value. We refer to something that is 64 bits (8 bytes) as a quad word.

Here is the breakdown of the names of memory sizes:

- Quad Word = 8 Bytes = 64 bits
- Double Word = 4 bytes = 32 bits
- Word = 2 bytes = 16 bits
- Byte = 1 byte = 8 bits

In x86_64, you can access each of these sizes when dereferencing an address, just like using bigger or smaller register accesses:

- `mov al, [address]` <=> moves the least significant byte from address to `rax`
- `mov ax, [address]` <=> moves the least significant word from address to `rax`
- `mov eax, [address]` <=> moves the least significant double word from address to `rax`
- `mov rax, [address]` <=> moves the full quad word from address to `rax`

Remember that moving into `al` does not fully clear the upper bytes.

Please perform the following: Set `rax` to the byte at `0x404000`.
