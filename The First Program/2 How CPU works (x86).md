 Interpreter = runs code directly, no binary or assembly generated    
Compiler = translates code into binary (via assembly)

Inside CPU= 4 type of logic gates

Computer Architecture (High level logic gates)
Moving toward smaller memory makes operations faster and faster
HDD>M.M>CACHE>REGISTERS = CPU pull from cache and store result in registers(1-16 bytes)
Multi core processor mean=More cache and more registers
