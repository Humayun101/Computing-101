Human cant understand binary, so the text representation of binary is called assembly which humans can understand
Binary and assembly code is equivalent

Assembly tell CPU what to do 
Human = sentences
assembly= operations/verb or operand/noun

Types of operands we deal with as data
data we directly give it as part of  instruction to CPU(money)
data that is close at cache or register(cash drawer)
data in storage (banks)
