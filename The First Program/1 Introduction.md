Even tho computer operate multiple programs, CPU only work on 1 at a time, but switch on speed of MIPS

Program=computer code=huge amount of individual instruction
Instructions are specified to the CPU in something called _Assembly Language_,and each CPU architecture uses a different flavor of this language. Any program, no matter what language it is originally written in (e.g., C, C++, Java, Python, etc.), is eventually converted to or interpreted by Assembly instructions.

World famous is x86 CPU architecture( ARM is 2nd famous to it)
